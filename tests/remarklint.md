The point of reference-style links is not that they’re easier to write.
The point is that with reference-style links, your document source is vastly more readable.
Compare the above examples: using reference-style links, the paragraph itself is 81 characters long; with inline-style links, it’s 176 characters;
and as raw `HTML`, it’s 234 characters. In the raw `HTML`, there’s more markup than there is text.
